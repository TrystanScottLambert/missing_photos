# missing_photos
Very simply bash script to find out who has missing photos on the ICRAR website


You can download the script with `git clone git@github.com:TrystanScottLambert/missing_photos.git`.

Make sure the script is executable:

```bash
chmod +x missing_photos_icrar.sh
```

run it
```bash
./missing_photos_icrar.sh
```

If you want to be able to run it in terminal whenever then you can add it to your /usr/local/bin

```bash
sudo mv missing_photos_icrar.sh /usr/local/bin
```

Then you can just run it in a terminal as `missing_photos_icrar`.
